## 📄 Abstract

This project presents the design and simulation of a **Smart and Safe Elevator System** using the **8051 microcontroller**, implemented through **Keil and Proteus**. The system enables **floor selection** using push-button switches and **displays the current floor number** via a **virtual terminal interface**.

To enhance safety, a **fire detection mechanism** is simulated using logic state input. On detecting a fire condition, the system prioritizes **emergency handling**, halts normal elevator operations, and activates **warning alerts**. This design emphasizes user safety, efficient floor navigation, and responsive handling of hazardous conditions.
